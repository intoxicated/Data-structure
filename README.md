Data-structure
==============

In 2013, I was bored and nothing to do, so I decided to explore around github for new project. I came across with this project "Algorithm Implementation" - implementing various algorithms in various langeuage. Sure! why not?, but then I thought algorithm itself is definitely important but it can be futher improved by using data-structures. Recent langauage such as Java, C++, and many others already provide basic data structures (linkedList, array, vector, stack, queue and etc) but it is also sufficient to know how these data structure works internally. So basically, same idea like "Algorithm Implementation", but for data-structure, I thought it would be nice to see data-structure implementations in various language.
